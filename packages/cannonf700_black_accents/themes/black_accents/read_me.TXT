NOTE: the original version of this theme had a small error that could cause the loss of information while using the theme.
This update has remedied this error BUT installing it over a previous installed version WILL cause loss of data.
This data, however, will still be in your Database and can be retrieved from there.

This theme uses a color background on its H1 and H2 tags that interfere with some of the core concrete5 interface.
For this reason the ability to see how these tags function in the TinyMCE/WYSIWYG editor have been disabled.
If this feature is important for you then you can edit the typogrophy.css file to reveal the styles
in the TinyMCE/WYSIWYG editor. just remove the " #container " prefix from each of the tags.

Sample of this template can be see at:
